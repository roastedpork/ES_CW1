# Prequisites for the coursework

## Windows Setup

Install python 2.7/3.6 for Windows, and install PuTTY in order to access the serial port.

General setup documentation can be found [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/micropython-basics-how-to-load-micropython-on-a-board/overview) 

To setup Micropython Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL) can be found [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/micropython-basics-how-to-load-micropython-on-a-board/serial-terminal) 

Drivers to install for windows for ESP8226 can be found [here](https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx)

Ampy failure troubleshoot can be found [here](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?t=2702) 

In summary:
+ Python - To install relevant micropython packages
+ Serial driver - To allow PuTTY to work later on
+ PuTTY - To get a real-time output from the embed
+ ampy - File manager for the embed which can be accessed via Windows command prompt

## ESP8266 WiFi Microcontroller
Datasheet for the microcontroller can be found [here](http://download.arduino.org/products/UNOWIFI/0A-ESP8266-Datasheet-EN-v4.3.pdf). 
There is no driver implementation for the microcontroller, which might require us to implement our own code for it. 

## Windows Setup for Interfacing
General setup documentation to load Micropython into the board can be found [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/micropython-basics-how-to-load-micropython-on-a-board/overview) 

To setup Micropython Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL) can be found [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/micropython-basics-how-to-load-micropython-on-a-board/serial-terminal) 

Drivers to install for windows for ESP8266 can be found [here](https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx)

Ampy failure troubleshoot can be found [here](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?t=2702) 

Instructions for installing ampy can be found [here](https://github.com/adafruit/ampy).  
The documentation for using I<sup>2</sup>C on the ESP8266 can be found [here](http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/library/machine.I2C.html). 

### Test script to check if setup successful:
```python 
import machine, time 
led = machine.Pin(0,machine.Pin.OUT)
while True:
	led.high()
	time.sleep(1.0)
	led.low() 
	time.sleep(1.0)
```

## I<sup>2</sup>C Interface
Refer to lecture 2 slides for specifics details of the interface. 
Most importantly, ensure that SCLK and SDA pins are connected correctly onto the mbed. 

### How to use I<sup>2</sup>C in MicroPython

After ensuring that the device is properly connected, a device can be instantiated using the following code (using VCNL4010 as an example):

```python
import machine

i2c = machine.I2C(scl = machine.Pin(5), sda = machine.Pin(4), freq = 100000)
```

This creates an I<sup>2</sup>C object for the device to handle the pins.
Every device has a specific device address that needs to be used to access its memory registers.
This can be found from the datasheet of the device of interest, but if that is not possible the following code can be used to determine the address(es):
```python
print i2c.scan() # Outputs [19] when the VCNL4010 is connected
```

For most intents and purposes, we would want to be able to read from/write to the device's memory registers.
For the VCNL4010, the registers are 0x80 to 0x90. 
The exact details the function of each register can be found in the datasheet.

### Writing data to the device
In order to write a 1 byte data to the device, we first have to encode the data into a byte type.

```python
# For VCNL4010, the device address is 0x13
# We intend to write a 1 byte value of 0xff into the memory register at address 0x80
buffer = str(0xff).encode()			# Encode the value into a byte type first			 
i2c.writeto_mem(0x13, 0x80, buffer)	# args passed as (device_add, mem_add, value)
```

### Reading data from the device
In order to read the data, we have to use a different method. 
Once again we would be using the VCNL4010 as an example, where we are attempting to obtain the light and proximity readings. 

```python
# Data memory registers are located from 0x85 to 0x88

# args passed as (device_add, starting_mem_add, no_of_bytes_read)
# 4 so that it reads 4 bytes starting from 085, ending at 0x88
raw_bytes = i2c.readfrom_mem(0x13, 0x85 ,4) 

# We need to convert this array of bytes into and array of int values by doing so
converted_bytes = bytearray(raw_bytes) 

# converted_bytes currently has 4 elements, [0] -> 0x85, [1]-> 0x86, [2] -> 0x87, [3] -> 0x88
```

Once we have converted the raw data into integer values, we can perform further processing in order to make sense of the data. 
Refer to VCNL4010.py or to the datasheet on how to perform this.

## Designated Sensor

A Sensor class for the Light and Proximity Sensor was created in vcnl4010.py, that is able to convert the reading from the sensor into a raw integer value.
More applications of the VCNL4010 sensor can be found [here](http://www.vishay.com/docs/84138/designingvcnl4010.pdf).


## Interaction with server via WiFis using MQTT
The documentation for MQTT sing MicroPython can be found [here](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/tree/master/umqtt.simple). 
This should be used as a basic message passing interface on top of the WiFi hardware.
Implement SSL encryption for message passing (optional, but we are doing it)
