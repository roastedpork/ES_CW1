# ES_CW1
Repository for EE3-24 Embedded Systems Coursework 1

## Prequisites for the coursework

### OS for Shell Terminal

~~Install [Bash on Windows](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/), or dual-boot a Linux VM for this coursework.~~

So apparently there is an issue with Bash on Windows with regards to connecting to its serial ports.
Follow the instructions [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/overview) for windows machines.

Install python 2.7/3.6 for Windows, and install PuTTY in order to access the serial port.

### How to use Git
You need to setup an RSA key to be able to SSH into the git repository. 
Alternatively, you can clone the repository via HTTPS, which requires you so fill in your login details everytime you push something in.

#### Basic setup for Git 
```
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/roastedpork/ES_CW1.git
```

#### Commiting to Git
```
git add --all
git commit -m "<insert your message here>"
git push
```

### ESP8266 WiFi Microcontroller
Datasheet for the microcontroller can be found [here](http://download.arduino.org/products/UNOWIFI/0A-ESP8266-Datasheet-EN-v4.3.pdf). 
There is no driver implementation for the microcontroller, which might require us to implement our own code for it. 

### Installing Micropython interpreter (ampy)
Instructions for installing ampy can be found [here](https://github.com/adafruit/ampy).  
The documentation for using I<sup>2</sup>C on the ESP8266 can be found [here](http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/library/machine.I2C.html). 

### I<sup>2</sup>C Interface
Refer to lecture 2 slides for specifics details of the interface. 
Most importantly, ensure that SCLK and SDA pins are connected correctly onto the mbed.

### Interaction with server via WiFis using MQTT
The documentation for MQTT can be found [here](https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io). 
This should be used as a basic message passing interface on top of the WiFi hardware.
